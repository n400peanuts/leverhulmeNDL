# Overview
This repo contains data, analysis and modelling scripts of the Leverhulme project: 
#### Language learning as expectation: a discriminative perspective ####

# Project description
This repo contains: 

* Modelling of the grant in the folder **[/modelling](https://github.com/n400peanuts/leverhulmeNDL/tree/master/modelling)**. 
To replicate yourself the modelling reported in this folder, **[Navigate to the R Markdown notebook](https://github.com/n400peanuts/leverhulmeNDL/blob/master/modelling/modellingGrant_strand1.Rmd)** 

* Experiment 1 (audio version) in the folder **[/exp1](https://github.com/n400peanuts/leverhulmeNDL/tree/master/exp1)**. 
* Experiment 2 (visual version) in the folder **[/exp2](https://github.com/n400peanuts/leverhulmeNDL/tree/master/exp2)**. 
* Experiment 3 (visual version + stimuli resized during learning + data collection in Tubingen) in the folder **[/exp3_tubingen](https://github.com/n400peanuts/leverhulmeNDL/tree/master/exp3_tubingen)**.
* Experiment 3 (visual version + stimuli resized during learning + data collection on Prolific) in the folder **[/exp3_prolific](https://github.com/n400peanuts/leverhulmeNDL/tree/master/exp3_prolific)**. 
* Experiment exp4_eyetrackerFribbles **[/exp4_eyetrackerFribbles](https://github.com/n400peanuts/leverhulmeNDL/tree/master/exp4_eyetrackerFribbles)**.
